## Key Takeaways
    - It's very hard to design in code unlike when using sites/apps like Canva
    - I've found that using <section> and <div> are the most helpful when doing the exercise
    - We can basically do the same thing as we do in Canva but it's harder. For example, I added a layering/stacking details which took me around 40 mins. to figure out. I could've done that in 2 minutes in Canva.
    - This is hard...
